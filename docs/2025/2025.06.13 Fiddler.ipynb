    "<p>However, I tend to find a burst of energy as I near the finish line. Therefore, I’ve tried intentionally running what’s called a “negative split,” meaning I run the second half of the race faster than the first half—as opposed to a “positive split,” where I run a slower second half.</p>\n",

    "<p><span>I want to take the concept of a negative split to the next level. My plan for an upcoming race—the “Zeno Paradox 5K”—is to start out with a 24-minute pace (i.e., running at a speed such that if I ran the </span><em>whole distance</em><span> at that speed, I’d finish in 24 minutes). Halfway through the race </span><em>by distance</em><span> (i.e., after 2500 meters), I’ll increase my speed by 10 percent. Three-quarters of the way through, I’ll increase by </span><em>another</em><span> 10 percent. If you’re keeping track, that’s now 21 percent faster than my speed at the start.</span></p>\n",
