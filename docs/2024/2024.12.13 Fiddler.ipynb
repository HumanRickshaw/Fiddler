    "<p>From John Hannon comes a puzzle inspired by a television show:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span>In the game show, </span><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Floor_(American_game_show)\" rel>The Floor</a></em><span>, 100 contestants are assigned to spaces on a 10×10 square grid. Over the course of a season, they compete one-on-one against their immediate neighbors by answering trivia questions. The loser of each duel is eliminated, and the square or squares they control are consigned to the winner.</span></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span>Let’s consider a slightly simplified version of </span><em>The Floor</em><span> with nine contestants on a 3×3 square grid. Each round of the game consists of the following steps:</span></p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><p>One of the remaining contestants is chosen at random. (Note that each contestant is equally likely to be chosen, regardless of how many squares they currently control.)</p></li>\n",
    "    <li><p>The set of eligible opponents for this contestant is anyone whose territory shares a common edge with the contestant. One of these eligible opponents is chosen at random. (Again, all eligible opponents are equally likely to be chosen, regardless of how many squares they control or how many edges they have in common with the opponent.)</p></li>\n",
    "    <li><p>The contestant and their selected opponent have a duel, each with a 50 percent chance of winning. The loser is eliminated, and their territory is added to that of the winner.</p></li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>These rounds repeat until one contestant remains, and that contestant is the overall winner.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span>You are a contestant on a new season of this 3×3 version of </span><em>The Floor</em><span>. The nine positions on the grid are shown below:</span></p>\n",
